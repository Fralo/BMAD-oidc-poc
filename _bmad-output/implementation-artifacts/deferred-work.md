# Deferred Work

Findings surfaced during step-04 review that are not in scope for the originating story but worth tracking so a later story owner can address them.

## From Story 1.1 review (2026-05-14)

### D1 — `.env.example` SQLite paths assume in-container `/data` mount

**Surfaced by:** Edge-case hunter, blind hunter
**Files:** `.env.example` (BFF_DATABASE_URL, RS_DATABASE_URL)
**Issue:** The placeholder URLs `sqlite+aiosqlite:////data/bff.db` and `…/rs.db` use the 4-slash absolute-path form pointing at `/data`. That path exists inside the BFF/RS containers (named volumes mounted at `/data`, per architecture I5), but not on a developer's host. A dev who runs the BFF on the host under the `dev` profile (per `docker-compose.yml` header comment) will hit `unable to open database file`.
**Belongs to:** Story 1.3 (BFF scaffold) and Story 3.1 (RS scaffold) — both will introduce per-profile env overrides (or document a host-side `data/` directory + per-host `.env` override). Story 1.1's job was only to enumerate AR29 vars; value-vs-perspective is a downstream concern.
**Severity:** important (deferred, not a Story 1.1 defect).

### D2 — OIDC URLs use container-internal hostname; browser-facing redirects will fail without a host alias

**Surfaced by:** Blind hunter, edge-case hunter
**Files:** `.env.example` (OIDC_ISSUER_URL, OIDC_JWKS_URL, OIDC_AUDIENCE, OIDC_CLIENT_ID)
**Issue 1:** `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` and `OIDC_JWKS_URL` resolve `keycloak:8080` via Docker DNS — fine for in-cluster traffic (BFF → Keycloak token exchange, RS → JWKS fetch). But the OIDC redirect step happens in the **browser** on the host, which cannot resolve `keycloak`. Stories 1.4–1.5 (BFF cookie/OIDC plugin) will need either a published port + `127.0.0.1 keycloak` `/etc/hosts` entry, or a split issuer (e.g., `KEYCLOAK_EXTERNAL_URL` for browser redirects, `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` for back-channel) reconciled by Keycloak's `frontendUrl` setting.
**Issue 2:** `OIDC_AUDIENCE == OIDC_CLIENT_ID == bff-client`. Keycloak does not put the client ID in the `aud` claim by default; without an audience mapper on the `bff-client` (or with token-introspection rather than local JWT validation in the RS), audience validation will fail.
**Belongs to:** Story 1.2 (Keycloak realm-as-code — owns the audience mapper) and Stories 1.4/1.5 (BFF OIDC plugin — owns the browser-facing redirect topology).
**Severity:** important (deferred; will cause real failures in Stories 1.4/1.5/3.2 if not handled there).

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-repo-scaffold-compose-skeleton (second pass, 2026-05-14)

### D3 — `change-me` placeholder credentials are silently accepted at runtime

**Surfaced by:** Blind hunter, edge-case hunter (second pass)
**Files:** `.env.example` (`KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `BFF_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TEST_RESET_TOKEN`)
**Issue:** AC #5 explicitly endorses `change-me` placeholders in `.env.example`, so this is not a Story 1.1 defect. The runtime risk is that a developer who literally copies `.env.example` → `.env` and runs `docker compose up` will boot Keycloak and the BFF with `change-me` as a real admin password / client secret / test-reset token. No downstream "you forgot to override this" guard exists. The "never enable in prod" comment for `ENABLE_TEST_RESET` is documentation, not enforcement.
**Belongs to:** Story 1.2 (Keycloak realm-as-code) — refuse boot if `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD == change-me` outside the `dev` profile. Story 1.4 (BFF auth-state schema) or Story 1.5 (BFF cookie/OIDC plugin) — refuse boot if `BFF_CLIENT_SECRET == change-me` outside `dev`. Story 1.12 (BFF `/v1/test/reset`) — refuse boot if `ENABLE_TEST_RESET=true` and `TEST_RESET_TOKEN == change-me`.
**Severity:** important (deferred; would not affect Story 1.1's AC but will cause silent misconfiguration once services exist).

### D4 — Per-service `.dockerignore` strategy is implicit

**Surfaced by:** Edge-case hunter (second pass)
**Files:** `.dockerignore` (repo root)
**Issue:** The repo-root `.dockerignore` is implicitly written for the case where `docker build` uses the repo root as its context. If Stories 1.3 / 3.1 instead use per-service contexts (`context: services/bff`, `context: services/resource-server`), the repo-root `.dockerignore` will not apply at all and a fresh per-service `.dockerignore` is needed. Conversely, if those stories use root context for per-service builds, the build context will over-include unrelated services. The architectural decision is not made by Story 1.1 and is not documented anywhere.
**Belongs to:** Story 1.3 (BFF scaffold) and Story 3.1 (RS scaffold) — must explicitly choose context strategy (root vs. service) and either rely on root `.dockerignore` or author per-service `.dockerignore` files.
**Severity:** important (architectural decision deferred; not a Story 1.1 defect).

### D5 — `.gitignore` `**/.env` whitelist is overly narrow

**Surfaced by:** Edge-case hunter (second pass)
**Files:** `.gitignore`
**Issue:** The pattern `**/.env` followed by only `!.env.example` whitelisting means any future per-service env template that is not named exactly `.env.example` (e.g., `services/bff/.env.dev`, `services/bff/.env.test`, `services/bff/.env.local.template`) is silently ignored. A contributor adds such a file, commits, and it does not get tracked; `git status` does not surface it. CI on a fresh clone breaks.
**Belongs to:** Whichever later story introduces per-service env templates (likely Stories 1.3 / 3.1 / 1.8). When that story lands, broaden the whitelist (e.g., `!**/.env.*.example`, `!**/.env.template`) and document the convention.
**Severity:** nit (deferred; only bites if a contributor introduces a non-`.env.example` template).
