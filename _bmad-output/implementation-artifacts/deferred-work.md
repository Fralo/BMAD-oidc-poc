# Deferred Work

Findings surfaced during step-04 review that are not in scope for the originating story but worth tracking so a later story owner can address them.

## From Story 1.1 review (2026-05-14)

### D1 — `.env.example` SQLite paths assume in-container `/data` mount

**Surfaced by:** Edge-case hunter, blind hunter
**Files:** `.env.example` (BFF_DATABASE_URL, RS_DATABASE_URL)
**Issue:** The placeholder URLs `sqlite+aiosqlite:////data/bff.db` and `…/rs.db` use the 4-slash absolute-path form pointing at `/data`. That path exists inside the BFF/RS containers (named volumes mounted at `/data`, per architecture I5), but not on a developer's host. A dev who runs the BFF on the host under the `dev` profile (per `docker-compose.yml` header comment) will hit `unable to open database file`.
**Belongs to:** Story 1.3 (BFF scaffold) and Story 3.1 (RS scaffold) — both will introduce per-profile env overrides (or document a host-side `data/` directory + per-host `.env` override). Story 1.1's job was only to enumerate AR29 vars; value-vs-perspective is a downstream concern.
**Severity:** important (deferred, not a Story 1.1 defect).

### D2 — OIDC URLs use container-internal hostname; browser-facing redirects will fail without a host alias

**Surfaced by:** Blind hunter, edge-case hunter
**Files:** `.env.example` (OIDC_ISSUER_URL, OIDC_JWKS_URL, OIDC_AUDIENCE, OIDC_CLIENT_ID)
**Issue 1:** `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` and `OIDC_JWKS_URL` resolve `keycloak:8080` via Docker DNS — fine for in-cluster traffic (BFF → Keycloak token exchange, RS → JWKS fetch). But the OIDC redirect step happens in the **browser** on the host, which cannot resolve `keycloak`. Stories 1.4–1.5 (BFF cookie/OIDC plugin) will need either a published port + `127.0.0.1 keycloak` `/etc/hosts` entry, or a split issuer (e.g., `KEYCLOAK_EXTERNAL_URL` for browser redirects, `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` for back-channel) reconciled by Keycloak's `frontendUrl` setting.
**Issue 2:** `OIDC_AUDIENCE == OIDC_CLIENT_ID == bff-client`. Keycloak does not put the client ID in the `aud` claim by default; without an audience mapper on the `bff-client` (or with token-introspection rather than local JWT validation in the RS), audience validation will fail.
**Belongs to:** Story 1.2 (Keycloak realm-as-code — owns the audience mapper) and Stories 1.4/1.5 (BFF OIDC plugin — owns the browser-facing redirect topology).
**Severity:** important (deferred; will cause real failures in Stories 1.4/1.5/3.2 if not handled there).
